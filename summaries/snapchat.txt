This privacy policy describes how we (Snapchat, Inc. and our subsidiaries) collect, use, and share your information whenever you use our Services.
Usage Information: We collect information about your activity and the messages you send and receive through our Services.
We also collect certain device information that will help us diagnose problems in the (hopefully rare) event you experience any crash or other problem while using our Services.
If another user allows us to collect information from his or her device phonebook—and you’re one of that user’s contacts—we may combine the information we collect from that user’s phonebook with other information we have collected about you.
What do we do with the information we collect?
For instance, when you set up an account we may pre-populate certain account information based on the information we collect about you from other users; And while you’re in another country, know that your information may be made available to government or law enforcement requests.
When you let us access your device phonebook, we may share information about you with other users who have your phone number in their device phonebook.
By going to those links or by using a co-branded or third-party-branded Service, you may be providing personal information directly to the third party, us, or both.
And again in most cases, the Services are programmed to delete the message from the recipients’ device as well.
These companies may collect information about how you use the Services and other websites and online services over time and across different services.
