As you use our services, we want you to be clear how we’re using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy.
For example, many of our services require you to sign up for a Google Account.
When you use our services or view content provided by Google, we automatically collect and store certain information in server logs.
When you use Google services, we may collect and process information about your actual location.
We and our partners use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit a Google service, and this may include sending one or more cookies or anonymous identifiers to your device.
We may use the name you provide for your Google Profile across all of the services we offer that require a Google Account.
One of the products we use to do this on our own services is Google Analytics.
We may combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other Google services – for example to make it easier to share things with people you know.
You can also opt out of certain Google advertising services here.
