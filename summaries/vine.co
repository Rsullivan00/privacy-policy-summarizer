This Privacy Policy describes how and when Vine collects, uses, and shares your information when you use Vine, including our mobile applications and websites (the "Services").
If you create your Vine account by connecting through another service, we may use public information from that connected account to help complete your Vine profile.
Some contact information may be required in order to use certain Services.
For example, you may upload information from your address book or connect your Vine account to your account on another service such as Twitter.
Content, Following, and other Public Information: Vine is a video sharing platform, so most of the information you provide us is information that you choose to be made public.
Vine may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services.
Vine uses Log Data to provide our Services and to measure, customize, and improve them.
These third-party service providers may use cookies and other technologies to collect information about your use of our Services and other websites and services, including your IP address, device ID, pages viewed, and links clicked.
If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we take steps to remove such information and terminate the child's account.
By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.
