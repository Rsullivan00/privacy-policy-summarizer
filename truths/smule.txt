We may use your email address to send you information about our Services, provide customer support or to notify you of additional Smule products and services.

This information will be primarily used for user registration and to enhance your social experience on our websites and applications, which may include friend-to-friend interaction and notifications, chat, or messaging functionality, public leaderboards, head-to-head competition and other similar features.
This means that we may tell our advertisers general information about the characteristics of our user base, but we do not specifically identify a particular user or visitor by name or provide the userâ€™s contact information.
