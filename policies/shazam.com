Please do not tell us anything that contains new or original ideas, in respect of which you might want, now or in future, to claim any form of proprietary rights.

Resolving Disputes
These Terms and the relationship between you and us shall be governed by the laws of England and Wales without regard to its conflict of law provisions. In the event of a dispute, we want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against us, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting legal@shazam.com. We'll try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email. If a dispute is not resolved within 15 days of submission, you or Shazam may bring a formal proceeding.
Outside of the United States . You and we agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.
In the United States . You and Shazam agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms or the Services through final and binding arbitration, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below. The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. The arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work, San Francisco (CA), or any other location we agree to. The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. Shazam will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than $75,000. If you receive an arbitration award that is more favorable than any offer we make to resolve the claim, we will pay you $1,000 in addition to the award. Shazam will not seek its attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous. Either you or Shazam may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco (CA) or any United States county where you live or work. Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above. You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations aren't allowed. In the event that the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you and Shazam agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the federal or state courts of San Francisco County (CA). Both you and Shazam consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there.

We may also share this aggregated data with our business partners and third party advertisers.
3. Sharing data with third parties – key facts and how to opt-out
We may share your information, such as your device and location information, with third parties including advertisers and partners, some of whom may use your data for the purposes of demographic, behavioral, and geographic ad targeting. Additionally, some third parties (such as companies who advertise through our apps) may require you to provide your personal data in order to access their products, adverts and offers. Any third parties’ use of your personal data is governed by their own privacy policy. To learn more about behavioral advertising or to opt-out of some types of behavioral advertising for participating ad networks, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative (http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) or the Digital Advertising Alliance ( http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). Also see section 10, “Select Third Party Partners” for a list of some of the parties with whom we share user information.
If you connect your Shazam account to Facebook or Google+ your name and your profile picture may be shared with other Shazam users. Further, your Facebook friends may be able to use the Shazam apps to search for or view your Shazam profile and the data contained therein, such as your tags and other activity including date/time. Go to the "preferences" screen to see your options to adjust the access levels to the data in your Shazam profile but, again, if you don't want a social network to get any access to your data, do not connect to that network via Shazam.
In the event that ownership of Shazam changes as a result of a merger, acquisition, or transfer to another company, your personal data may be transferred. If such a transfer results in a material change in the use of your personal data, then Shazam will provide you with appropriate notice.

We may display links to third party websites and apps. Please note that we cannot control and cannot be held responsible for the activities of such websites and apps. You should always read the privacy policy of a website or app to find out more about how personal data is collected and processed.
5. Use of Cookies
Like most web sites and mobile applications, we use cookies to track site usage, to send you adverts and to customise your experience of Shazam. A cookie is a tiny text or graphics file that resides on your computer, mobile phone, or other device, and allows us and/or our business partners to recognise you as a user. For more detail on how businesses use cookies on websites, please see www.allaboutcookies.org . You can find an overview of the various types of cookies used by Shazam and/or our business partners, in the table below.
Cookie Type Purpose
Essential Operational These cookies are necessary to allow us to operate the Shazam websites and apps as you have requested. These cookies, for example, let us recognize what type of subscriber you are and then provide you with the services to which you are entitled.
Performance These cookies are used by us or our business partners to analyse how the Shazam websites and apps are used and how they are performing. These cookies do not let us identify users (as all user data is aggregated). They are also used to monitor when you link from our app to one of our partner apps so that we can check what levels of traffic we are generating for our partner apps.
Functional These cookies let us operate certain functions of the Shazam websites and apps in line with the choices you make. These cookies mean that we can "remember" you in-between visits – e.g. we will recognize your user name and remind you how you customised our services and what music you enjoyed on your last visit.

6. Sorry kids, over 13s only
We take our responsibilities to the online community very seriously. As such, if you are under the age of 13 we have to ask you not to use our apps or websites in any way. We don't knowingly collect data from anyone under the age of 13 and we do not direct any of our products or services at this age group.

You can update your personal data through the Shazam apps and you can ask us about what data we are holding by sending us an email. We will do our best to respond to your request (upon verification of your identity) within a reasonable period of time. California Civil Code Section 1798.83 also permits users who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of the third parties to whom we disclosed their personal data (if any) for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year and the categories of data disclosed to those third parties. To make any sort of access request, please email or write to us using the details above.
